            <h2>Hello</h2>
            <h4>I am Aniyah Veal. I'm a senior at Temple University, majoring in English. I've been writing short stories and the occasional poem since my senior year of high school. These are the products of my classwork and spare time.</h4>
            
            <h4>Although I enjoy poetry, my main focus is on writing fiction pieces. I will share some of my poetry, but I feel my real talent is writing fiction. I don't think I have one genre that I tend to write within. My fiction writing style is more consistent than the genre I’ll write in. I like exploring the strength of connection in relationships and how bonds bleed into interactions. I’m fascinated with body language, internal thoughts and what’s said and/or not said in a conversation, all of which is evident in my writing. </h4>
